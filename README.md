A python program that converts user input to morse code, then outputs that to a Circuit Playground circuit board, flashing its LEDs to communicate the message.
The user is prompted for a length of time that determines how long to wait between parts of a single character, between letters and between words.
They are the prompted for a sentence which is then converted to lowercase and filtered to remove unwanted characters. The equivalent morse code is placed in a list.
The morse code is displayed using the LEDs on the circuit board.
